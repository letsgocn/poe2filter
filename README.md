# poe2filter.com

I built an easy-to-use PoE2 custom loot filter generation website, allowing you to generate your own filter which does exactly what you want: filter out clutter you're not interested in, and highlight items you probably don't want to miss.

https://poe2filter.com

- Hides items you're not interested in.
- Shows weapon and armour types of your choice.
- Marks important items with a tiered beam and displays them on the minimap.
- Doesn't change styles. Don't ruin the game's amazing graphics and atmosphere with ugly and inconsistend colors and font sizes.

I've been using this filter myself for a few days now, it makes the game so much more enjoyable. Thought I'd share it with everyone. You probably only want to start using this around halfway the campaign.
